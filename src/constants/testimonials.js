      "I recently had the pleasure of experiencing the KMG Blue Eye shuttle bus service, and it was a delightful surprise. The shuttle, driven by Toni, picked me up promptly at 9:20 AM from a clearly marked pier-side hotel. It was a comfortable, air-conditioned ride, incredibly affordable at just 15 euros round-trip—half the price quoted by local taxis. Toni’s engaging stories and insightful commentary made the 30-minute journey enjoyable and informative. For anyone visiting the Blue Eye, KMG's shuttle service is a hassle-free, budget-friendly, and highly recommended way to explore this beautiful destination.",
